INSTALL :: INSTRUCTIONS

The following instructions covers each admin tool in this codebase.
Maybe once there are a fair few tools here, I'll consider splitting up
the base and/or the INSTALL/README files.

NGINX INIT.D #########################################################

Install the script to your init.d folder and chmod+x as usual

	cp ./nginx-initd /etc/init.d/nginx
	chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx

USAGE

	/etc/init.d/nginx {start|stop|restart|reload}

NGENSITE #############################################################

This script must be chmod+x'd and put into a directory in your PATH

The script assumes that your site configurations are found under your
nginx site root, following the basic structure below:

/etc/nginx
|
|-- sites-available/
|   |-- example.com
|   |-- test.example.com
|   `-- default
|-- sites-enabled/
`-- nginx.conf

Then, the script must be symlinked via ngdissite so as to be able 
to disable (that almost rhymes) the hosts.

Once installed and running, the ngensite tool will create symlinks in 
the 'enabled' directory, pointing towards those in the 'available'.

This could for example be done as follows

	chmod +x ./ngensite
	cp ./ngensite /usr/sbin/ngensite
	ln -s /usr/sbin/ngensite /usr/sbin/ngdissite

USAGE

ngensite example.com

ngensite will attempt to set up a symlink from
sites-available/example.com to sites-enabled/example.com

Failure to find the file(s) in correct location, or permission errors,
will result in failure.
